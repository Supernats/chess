Chess
=====

For a first crack at chess, I'm quite pleased with it. Interaction is completely CLI, which is cool if you miss your old Kaypro. Checks against check(mate) are handled by a 'dup and check' system for validation. Inheritance is used wherever possible, even if the base class isn't an actual chess piece. The more complex maneuvers of castling and en passant are not implemented, but it DOES have color. This project was done pairing with gkchestertron.
